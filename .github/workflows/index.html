    <h1><b>李晨睿的簡要自傳</b></h1>
   <p>
     <h3>一、家庭生活</h3><br>
     <div style="text-align: left;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;我出生在新竹，風的都市。家庭經濟普通，但十分和睦，我的許多親戚家人都有教育背景，我也因此踏上了這條路。   
   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;另外，就父母的養育風格來說，他們採取一半民主，一半放養，因此我很隨和容易相處，也很獨自自主，能為自己負責，為自己的未來做規劃。</div>
<h3>二、求學與服務經歷</h3><br>
   <div style="text-align: left;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;小學與國中我都在市區中的學校讀書，排名在10名內，擔任過學藝股長等；後以5A1+進入新竹的第二志願「竹北高中」，雖沒像當初國中小排名好，但也平平淡淡，並有幸以校內自主學習成果競賽優等的成績代表學校參與竹區的自主學習成果發表；最後我以個人申請的方式成功申請上「嘉義大學幼兒教育學系」，並參加「民雄瑜伽社」。<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;大學修課方面，在112學年第一學期共修習25學分，以平均93.2分位列班排第2名，此學期我有多加選一堂通識課，為以後空出更多時間彈性運用；在112學年第二學期共修習29學分，以平均89.9分位列班排第4名，此學期我有多加修「數位學習設計與管理學系」的必修「數位學習概論」以及選修「動畫概論」，因此對數位學習有了基礎的概念，並學會了動畫製作，可運用於以後教材的製作，後成功申請113學年的「數位學習設計與管理學系」輔系；在113學年第一學期共修習34學分，幼教系與數位系各分別15學分，有下修本系大一的「創造思考教學」，並加修數位系的「設計概論」、「應用統計學」、「資料庫系統」、「多媒體的程式設計」以及「程式設計」，學會了資料庫的架設、基本網頁的建構、分析資料的基本能力並會看文章中的資料分析以及場景、人物等的繪圖技巧與架構，後預計於學期末申請「數位學習設計與管理學系」的雙主修。<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;大學課餘時間方面，於112學年第二學期時擔任「民雄瑜伽社副社長」，協助社長處理活動企劃書、成果書等的計劃與製作，後於113學年第一學期時接任「民雄瑜伽社社長」，進行社博擺攤（成功將社員人數從5人左右變為15人以上）、社課時間安排（因本學期卡到多次放假，學會與社員老師進行協調）、社課內容安排（辦理三次器材體驗課程）、企劃書與成果書撰寫（申請學生會器材補助的評鑑、申請學務組的活動補助，成果書部分會使用表單收集社員的回饋）、製作支出表預算表等掌握社團資金流向，以及根據到課人數添購共用瑜伽墊、瑜伽球和彈力繩等器材。</div>

<h3>三、生涯規劃願景</h3><br>
   <div style="text-align: left;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;未來計畫將申請延畢兩年，第一年補完雙主修必修學分，並視情況加修小教學程，第二年欲申請前往日本上越教育大學修讀幼兒園或國小相關課程一學期，第二學期回台灣進行半年實習取得教師證，畢業後邊打工邊備考清大「學習科學與科技研究所」，最後對於未來職業規劃，是希望能在教育局當科員、在小學母校的幼兒園當老師或當一位教材設計師。</div>

  <h1><b>A Brief Autobiography of Li, CHEN-RUEI</b></h1>
  <p>
     <h3>1. Family Life</h3><br>
     <div style="text-align: left;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Hsinchu, the City of Winds. My family’s financial situation is average, but it is a very harmonious one. Many of my relatives have an educational background, which is why I embarked on this path. Among them, my older sister is a student in the education field.   
   <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding my parents' upbringing style, they have a mix of democratic and hands-off approaches. As a result, I am easygoing, sociable, and independent. I am able to take responsibility for myself and plan for my own future.</div>
<h3>2. Education and Service Experience</h3><br>
   <div style="text-align: left;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended schools in the city for both elementary and junior high school, consistently ranking within the top 10. I held roles such as arts and culture committee leader. Later, I entered my second-choice school, National Chupei Senior High School in Hsinchu, with a 5A1+ score. Although my ranking was not as high as before, I had a smooth experience and had the honor of representing the school in a local autonomous learning competition, earning a top prize. I successfully applied to the Department of Early Childhood Education, National Chiayi University through personal application and joined the NCYU MS Yoga Club.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of university coursework, I completed 25 credits in the first semester of the 112th academic year, ranking second in my class with an average score of 93.2. I also took an additional general education course to create more flexible time for future semesters. In the second semester of the 112th academic year, I completed 29 credits and ranked fourth in my class with an average score of 89.9. During this semester, I took the required Introduction to e-Learning and an elective Introduction to Animation in the Department of e-Learning Design and Management. This gave me a basic understanding of digital learning and animation production, which I can use in creating future teaching materials. Later, I successfully applied for a minor in e-Learning Design and Management for the 113th academic year.
In the first semester of the 113th academic year, I completed 34 credits, with 15 credits from the Department of Early Childhood Education and 15 from the Department of e-Learning Design and Management. I took the Instruction of Creative Thinking course from the first-year curriculum and additional courses such as Introduction to Design, Applied Statistics, Database Systems, Multimedia Programming, and Programming in the Digital Learning Department. I learned database setup, basic webpage construction, data analysis, and skills in drawing scenes and characters. I plan to apply for a double major in e-Learning Design and Management at the end of this semester
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of extracurricular activities, during the second semester of the 112th academic year, I served as the Vice President of the NCYU MS Yoga Club, assisting the president with activity planning, proposal writing, and other tasks. In the first semester of the 113th academic year, I became the president of the club. I helped organize club recruitment booths (successfully increasing membership from around 5 to over 15 members), arranged class schedules (learning how to coordinate with instructors due to frequent holidays), planned course content (held three equipment experience sessions), wrote proposals and reports (applied for equipment subsidies from the student council and activity subsidies from the student affairs office), and managed the club's financial budget. I also purchased shared equipment such as yoga mats, yoga balls, and resistance bands based on attendance numbers.</div>

<h3>3. Career and Vision</h3><br>
   <div style="text-align: left;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My future plan is to apply for an extension of two years. In the first year, I will complete the required courses for my double major and possibly add a minor in teaching. In the second year, I plan to apply for a semester at Joetsu University of Education in Japan to study early childhood or elementary education courses. After returning to Taiwan, I aim to do a six-month internship to obtain my teaching certificate. After graduation, I plan to work part-time while preparing for the graduate school entrance exam for the Institute of Learning Sciences and Technologies at National Tsing Hua University. Ultimately, my career goal is to work as a staff member in the education bureau, as a teacher in the kindergarten at my elementary school alma mater, or as a teaching material designer.</div>
